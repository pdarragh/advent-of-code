# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to AoC 2020. I chose to use Haskell, and I tried to focus
on writing solutions I found aesthetically pleasing or educational instead of
just writing the simplest one-liner.

Each sub-directory contains:

  * `README.md`: the instructions for the problem.
  * `input.txt`: my input for the problem.
  * `solution.hs`: my solutions to the problem.
  * `Makefile`: a simple Makefile for building the executable, which will be
    named `solution`. The executables built by the Makefile are run without any
    arguments.
